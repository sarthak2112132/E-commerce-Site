       Leaders build organisations by building a Founder's mindset.
       </p>
       <p className='lg:text-5xl lg:font-semibold font-bold pt-20 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
       Leaders assume responsibility for everything
       </p>
       <p className='lg:text-3xl lg:font-sans font-serif pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
     They believe they control how things happen or don’t, and proactively make a choice to focus on them or not.
       Leaders look <br/>into the mirror and take ownership for failures while looking out of the window giving their teams credit for their successes
       </p>
       <p className='lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
        Leaders are great communicators
        </p>
        <p className='lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
        They just don’t think they are right, they can also verbalise and make other people see the world through their eyes. This <br/>doesn’t mean that they are only sellers, they also believe and repeatedly prove what they are saying is true. A good leader<br/>conveys expectations, feedback, challenges and context etc. in a simple, honest and timely manner, while maintaining an<br/> open channel for the same things to flow upwards from the people they lead
        </p>
        <p className='lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-20 lg:pl-16 pl-8' >
        Leaders listen
        </p> 
        <p className='lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
        The truth is, someone in a position of leadership will likely have more knowledge and or experience in a given situation, but if <br/>someone has a perspective to share, it's important for a leader to demonstrate a willingness to listen and accept that there<br/>may be more realities than just the one they know. They can totally choose not to follow said perspective, but listening builds<br/> trust and respect
        </p>
        <p className='lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
        Leaders face problems upfront and fast
        </p>
        <p className='lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
        They know that delays in addressing problems create untrackable debt. They foster a culture that wants to head towards <br/>solving the bigger problems first, everyday
        </p>
        <p className='lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
        Leaders treat tough times as tough problems, nothing more
        </p>
        <p className='lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8'>
        They have the intellectual honesty to admit their mistakes, and move on with the knowledge of the lessons, without being,<br/> weighed down by the baggage. They deeply understand that we are better off watching the next move, than dwelling on the <br/>reasons for landing in tough times
        </p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders believe they can change anything</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 pl-16">This is not foolish optimism, but rather a belief that they can make a positive impact by leveraging the knowledge of others<br/> or learning on their own. Leaders deeply understand that the ability to help people do better is a powerful weapon for<br/> change</p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders believe that change starts with them</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 pl-16">The ability to start with an idea and take it to a point where it can be a reality, starts with a leader's willingness to lead the<br/> change. Leaders share their ideas and beliefs openly in order to make them a reality</p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders provide forward momentum</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 pl-16">Things will always have a tendency to slow down or settle into a routine. A leader constantly avoids this sloth and challenges<br/> everyone to a higher goal. It means avoiding stasis, in every way possible. Leadership is the ability to constantly drive<br/> forward momentum</p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders are a source of energy</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Radiating energy to everyone, through everyone. They push for upsides, as opposed to just protecting the downside. They push<br/> people to want to achieve more, not fear more</p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders make the entire company head in the direction that is the best possible</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Given the information they have. In addition to making things happen, they also seek and provide clarity in that direction by<br/> engaging in a constant balance between advocacy and inquiry. For a leader, local optima does not matter</p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders make choices that have a bias towards action</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Delaying a decision is a decision too. Leaders consciously differentiate between problems that are one-way doors and two-<br/>way doors, and solve for speed in decision making, irrespective</p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders have a learning mindset</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">They are open to new ideas and have a reasonable amount of meaningful input for each aspect of the business. They<br/> understand that when we try to defend our egos, rather than grow and change, we end up perfectly designed for a world<br/> that happened already, instead of growing better able to handle the world that is coming next. With this in mind – they<br/> constantly seek feedback and invest in their own and the organisations learning at large</p>
        <p className="lg:text-5xl font-semibold pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">Leaders raise the bar on each and every hire</p>
        <p className="lg:text-3xl font-sans pt-10 lg:pl-16 pl-8">They always seek to hire people who will raise the bar for the team on some vector. They are keenly looking to find, hire and<br/> train people to be better than themselves, because they understand that the whole is larger than the sum of its parts</p>
